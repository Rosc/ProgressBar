A simple browser template that compares the contents of an external text document against a user defined value to generate a progrees bar.
The external text document can be maniplated by the user or another program to dynamically change the bar's progress.

To use:

1: (Optional) Edit progressbar.htm to set your desired colors and refresh timer.
2: Set up the external source.  This document should be a simple text document with only a number on a single line.
3: Open progressbar.htm in Chrome (It may work in other browsers, but it has only been tested in Chrome)
4: Fill the value your external source will be evaluated against in the textbox
5: Click "Choose File" and locate your external source
6: Enjoy

If there's sufficient interest, this will be expanded into a more robust tool.  I'm already spitballing some ideas to improve its aesthetics and functionality.

Feel free to use it in your project, stream, whatever, but please don't sell it.  That's not cool.
